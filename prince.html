                <p>Machiavelli needs to be looked at as he really was. Hence: Can Machiavelli, who makes the following observations, be Machiavellian as we understand the disparaging term?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>1. So it is that to know the nature of a people, one need be a Prince; to know the nature of a Prince, one need to be of the people.
                    <br>
                    2. If a Prince is not given to vices that make him hated, it is unsusal for his subjects to show their affection for him.
                    <br>
                    3. Opportunity made Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus, and others; their virtue domi-nated the opportunity, making their homelands noble and happy. Armed prophets win; the disarmed lose.
                    <br>
                    4. Without faith and religion, man achieves power but not glory.
                    <br>
                    5. Prominent citizens want to command and oppress; the populace only wants to be free of oppression.
                    <br>
                    6. A Prince needs a friendly populace; otherwise in diversity there is no hope.
                    <br>
                    7. A Prince, who rules as a man of valor, avoids disasters,
                    <br>
                    8. Nations based on mercenary forces will never be solid or secure.
                    <br>
                    9. Mercenaries are dangerous because of their cowardice
                    <br>
                    10. There are two ways to fight: one with laws, the other with force. The first is rightly man’s way; the second, the way of beasts.</p>
